    after a few days of getting deeper following the path I spotted A deserted mansion Finger-traced dust unveiled '1902' etched into the cornerstone. I started running towards my house to call my friends but I tripped and fell. And when I woke up I was in the cabin in the middle of the forest and I tried to get up but I couldn't because of a sharp pain in my leg A myriad of footprints, all leading to a rickety wooden desk. Suddenly, I heard the door creak, and opening and an old man stepped in. He went to the desk and he took something not ordinary from there. and told me: "Oh finally, you woke up!". Splattered with leeching ink, a parchment map unfurled, held by his gnarled arthritis-ridden hands. "I need you to help me  you're stronger. I wanna know what's behind the waterfall ridge. I need it for my map".`

The wisp trapped inside dances like a flickering flame, casting long, intricate shadows over the wind-etched silver and sapphire backdrop, adding to the mysterious undertones of the RPG world.' and also reference this: "An ethereal lantern, seemingly made from the chill of the mountaintop itself. Within its crystal-clear enclosure, a blue wisp flickers restlessly, providing a reclusive yet unwavering light, likely to come handy when navigating through the darkness.". The design should fill the entire frame. No additional text besides the title.
    // the back side of the card is generated by this prompt: "Card texture: Channeling the haunting beauty of Art Nouveau entwined with the chilling mystique of Siberian folklore, envision a backdrop swirling with icy blues and silvers. The edges of the card give the impression of frost creeping in, while delicate filigree designs, reminiscent of icicles, drape from the top and bottom. Central to this is an archetypal emblem of a mountain, surrounded by flourishes that suggest gusts of wind and snow. The design encapsulates the cold, mysterious aura of the Bear's Fang Summit and the secrets of the Ancient Lighthouse, all in an RPG essence."".
